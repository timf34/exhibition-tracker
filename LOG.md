*Working notes*
- The new modularized backend seems to be much slower than our simple exhibitions_pipeline.py script... do check this out or if its just the case that our api calls are slow potentially. 

*Leaving notes*
- We have made things look more professional and more modularized here but I think things can and should look much simpler (for the backend)!
