*Working notes*
- The new modularized backend seems to be much slower than our simple exhibitions_pipeline.py script... do check this out or if its just the case that our api calls are slow potentially. 

*Next steps*
- Try to find out how to test/ clean our list of URLs to museums exhibitions pages a bit better. Probably use a selenium driver/ browser mode as a backup if the direct request doesn't work.
- Be able to toggle on or off the "details" part of our pipeline, as I think that's quite slow and a bit more expensive to run.

*Other notes*
- We have made things look more professional and more modularized here but I think things can and should look much simpler (for the backend)!
- Maybe do a little bit more normalisation of like artist names
